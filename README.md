# bs-support-utils(Bootstrap Support Utilities)
"bs-support-utils extends Bootstrap with additional CSS classes for cursor, padding, margin, gaps, and sizing. Offering fine-grained styling control beyond Bootstrap's core utilities."

## Features

- **Cursor Utilities**: Adds cursor-pointer and other cursor-related utility classes missing in Bootstrap.
- **Padding Utilities (Pixels)**: Offers padding utility classes from `p-px-1` to `p-px-100`, providing more options than Bootstrap's `p-1` to `p-5` (which are in rem units).
- **Extended Utilities**: Future releases will include padding in percentage (`p-pr-1` to `p-pr-100`), margin utilities from `m-px-1` to `m-px-100` and `m-pr-1` to `m-pr-100`, gap properties, and width and height utilities ranging from 1 to 100, significantly extending Bootstrap's `w-25`, `w-50`, `w-75`, and `w-100`.
